<p>Please be advised that the February 9, 2015 General Rate Increase (GRI), applicable on the Asia & Indian Sub-Continent to Canada tradelane, has been mitigated. New rates effective February 9th will be published shortly.</p>
<p>Meanwhile it should be noted that vessel space on the Transpacific Eastbound tradelane continues to be very tight. Delmar highly recommends that all bookings be made at least 2-3 weeks in advance of intended vessel departure during the peak shipping period leading up to and following the Lunar New Year & Spring Festival holidays in China, occurring this year from February 18-24.</p>
